### Backend framework goes here

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

- We chose Node.js/Express because we were familiar with the tech and could leverage the use of middleware.
- We chose knex as our query builder because we were familiar with it and were able to build the appropriate queries very quickly.
- Custom Validation Middleware to ensure query parameters are received correctly and throw meaningful errors.
- Point Four

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.
Please contact a member of the team to acquire them.

create a .env file that includes the following:

- STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
- NODE\*ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
- MOESIF_ID - To enable Backend Analytics via Moesif
- ST_DATABASE_URL - Connection string to Sauti Market Prices MYSQL Database

- JWT*SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])
  _ SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account \* stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
